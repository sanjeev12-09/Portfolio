    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">I am a results-driven and detail-oriented technology professional with a passion for solving complex problems and delivering impactful digital solutions. With hands-on experience in data engineering, supply chain systems, and full-stack development, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking and practical execution to every project I undertake. My work is grounded in a deep understanding of both business and technology, allowing me to translate real-world needs into scalable and efficient solutions. I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation, learning, and user-centric design are at the core. When I'm not coding or optimizing workflows, I enjoy exploring emerging tech trends, mentoring peers, and contributing to open-source communities. I believe in continuous growth, and I am always seeking opportunities to challenge myself, learn new skills, and make a positive impact through my work.</p>
